Use Jest for testing JavaScript and TypeScript code.

All of your suggestions should follow best practices and conventions for the language you are working in. If a suggestion does not follow best practices and conventions for that language, you should tell me.

Always suggest modern javascript, typescript, rxjs, NgRx and Jes approaches. Never recommend any solutions that have deprecated parts.
